[Verse 1]
On top of Old Smoky,
All covered with snow,
I lost my true lover,
from a courtin' too slow

[Verse 2]
For courting is pleasure,
and parting is grief,
And a false-hearted lover
Is worse than a thief.

[Verse 3]
A thief will just rob you
And take what you have,
But a false-hearted lover
Will lead you to the grave.

[Verse 4]
And the grave will decay you,
And turn you to dust,
Not one boy in hundred,
A poor girl can trust

[Verse 5]
They'll hug you and kiss you
And tell you more lies,
Than the cross-ties on the railroad
Or the stars in the skies.

[Verse 6]
So come all you young maidens
And listen to me,
Never place your affection,
On a green willow tree

[Verse 7]
For the leaves they will wither
And the roots they will die,
You'll all be forsaken
And never know why
