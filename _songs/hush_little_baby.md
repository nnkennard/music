Hush little baby, don't say a word,
Momma's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

If that mockingbird don't sing, 
Momma's gonna buy you a diamond ring.

If that diamond ring is glass,
Momma's gonna buy you a looking glass.

If that looking glass gets broke, 
Momma's gonna buy you a billy goad.

If that billy goat won't pull, 
Momma's gonna buy you a cart and bull.

If that cart and bull turn over,
Momma's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.

If that dog named Rover won't bark,
Momma's gonna buy you a horse and card.

If that horse and cart fall down, 
you'll be the sweetest baby in town.
