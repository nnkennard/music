[Verse 1]
As I was a-goin' on down the road,
with a tired team and a heavy load,
I cracked my whip and the leader sprung,
I says day-day to the wagon tongue.

[Chorus]
Turkey in the straw, (haw, haw, haw),
Turkey in the hay, (hay, hay, hay),
Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuck-a-haw,
And hit 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw

[Verse 2]
Oh, I went out to milk and I didn't know how,
I milked a goat instead of a cow.
A monkey sittin' on a pile of straw,
A-winkin' his eye at his mother-in-law.

[*Chorus*]

[Verse 3]
Well, I met Mister Catfish comin' down the stream,
Says Mister Catfish, "what do you mean?"
I caught Mister Catfish by the snout
And I turned that Catfish wrong side out.

[*Chorus*]

[Verse 4]
Then I come to the river and I couldn't get across,
So I paid five dollars for a blind horse.
Well He wouldn't go ahead and he wouldn't stand still,
So he went up and down like an old saw mill

[*Chorus*]

[Verse 5]
As I came down a new cut road,
I met Mister Bullfrogg a-courtin' MIss Toad,
And every time Miss Toad would sing,
The old Bullfrog cut a pigeon wing.

[*Chorus*]
