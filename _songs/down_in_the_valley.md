Down in the valley, the valley so low
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow.  


Roses love sunshine, violets love dew
Angels in heaven, know I love you.
Know I love you, dear, know I love you.
Angels in heaven, know I ove you.

If you don't love me, love whom you please.
Throw your arms round me, give my heart ease.
Give my heart ease, love, give my heart ease.
Throw your arms round me, give my heart ease.

Build me a castle forty feet high
So I can see him as he rides by.
As he rides by, love, as he rides by
So I can see him as he rides by.

Write me a letter, send it by mail
Send it in care of Birmingham jail.
Birmingham jail, love, Birmingham jail
Send it in care of, Birmingham jail.

[*Repeat first verse*]
