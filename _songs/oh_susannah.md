[Verse 1]
I come from Alabama with
a banjo on my knee,
I'm goin' to Louisiana
my true love for to see

[Verse 2]
It rained all night the day I left,
The weather it was dry,
The sun so hot, I froze to death,
Susannah don't you cry.

[Chorus]
Oh, Susannah,
Oh don't you cry for me.
I come from Alabama with
A banjo on my knee

[Verse 3]
I had a dream the other night,
When everything was still,
I dreamed I saw Susannah,
A-coming down the hill

[*Chorus*]

[Verse 4]
A red red rose was in her cheek,
A tear was in her eye.
I said to her, Susannah girl,
Susannah don't you cry.

[*Chorus*]
