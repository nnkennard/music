You get a line and I'll get a pole, honey
You get a line and I'll get a pole, babe.
You get a line and I'll get a pole, 
And we'll go down to the crawdad hole
Honey sugar baby, mine.

Get up old man you slept too late, honey,
Get up old man, you slept too late, babe
Get up old man, you slept too late,
Last piece of crawdad's on your plate
Honey, sugar baby, mine.

[*Continue as above*]

Get up old woman, you slept too late,
Crawdad man done passed your gate

Along came a man with a sack on his back
Packin' all the crawdads he can pack

What you gonna do when the lake goes dry,
Sit on the bank and watch the crawdads die

What you gonna do when the crawdads die
Sit on the bank until I cry

I heard the duck say to the drake
There ain't no crawdads in this lake.
