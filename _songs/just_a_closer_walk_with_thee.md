Just a closer walk with Thee,
Grant it Jesus if you please.
Daily walking close to Thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

Through the days of toil that's near
If I fall dear Lord, who cares
Who with me my burden share,
None but Thee, dear Lord, None but Thee.

When my feeble life is o'er
Time for me will be no more;
Guide me gently safely on,
To Thy shore, dear Lord, to Thy shore.
