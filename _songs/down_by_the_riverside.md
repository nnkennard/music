[Verse 1]
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield,
Down by the riverside, Down by the riverside, down by the riverside,
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield,
Down by the riverside,
Gonna study war no more

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna study war no more, I ain't gonna study war no more (*3x*)

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna walk with the Prince of Peace,
Down by the riverside, Down by the riverside, down by the riverside,
I'm gonna walk with the Prince of Peace,
Down by the riverside,
And study war no more

[*Chorus*]

[Verse 3]
I'm a'gonna shake hands around the world,
Down by the riverside, Down by the riverside, down by the riverside,
I'm gonna shake hands around the world,
Down by the riverside,
And study war no more

[*Chorus*]
