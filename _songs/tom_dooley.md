Hang your head Tom Dooley, hang your head and cry
Killed poor Laura Foster, you know you're bound to die.

You took her on the hillside as God almighty knows,
You took her on the hillside and there you hid her clothes.

You took her by the roadside where you begged to be excused,
You took her by the roadside where there you hid her shoes.

You took her on the hillside to make her your wife
You took her on the hillside where there you took her life.

Take down my old violin and play it all you please
At this time tomorrow it'll be no use to me.

I dug a grave four feet long, I dug it three feet deep
And throwed the cold clay o'er her, and tramped it with my feet.

This world and one more then where do you reckon I'd be
If it hadn't been for Grayson, I'd-a-been in Tennessee.
