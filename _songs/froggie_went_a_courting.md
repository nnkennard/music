Mister Froggie went a-courting and he did ride, mhmm, mhmm
Mister Froggie when a-courting and he did ride,
With a sword and pistol by his side mhmm, mhmm

So off he went with his opera hat mhmm, mhmm
So off he went with his opera hat, 
And on the way he met a rat mhmm, mhmm

[*Continue as above*]

But he went on to Miss Mouse's door
Where he had been many times before

He took Miss Mousy on his knee
And asked her "Will you marry mee?"

"Without my daddy Rat's consent,
I wouldnt' marry the President."

So uncle Rat gave his consent,
And the Weasel wrote the publishment.

The owl did hoot and the birds they sang
All through the woods the music rang.

What will the wedding breakfast be?
Two green beans and a black-eyed pea.

They all went sailing across the brook,
And a big white duck came and gobbled them up.

There's bread and cheese upon the shelf,
If you want anymore you can sing it yourself.
