[Verse 1]
When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give him a hearty welcome then
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The men will cheer and the boys will shout,
The ladies, they will all turn out,
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny come's marching home

[Verse 2]
The old church bell will peak with joy
Hurrah! Hurrah!
To welcome home our darling boy
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The village lads and lassies say,
With roses they will strew the way,
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny come's marching home

[Verse 3]
Get ready for the jubilee,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
We'll give the hero three times three,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The laurel wreath is ready now,
To place upon his loyal brow,
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny come's marching home

[Verse 4]
Let love and friendship on that day,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Their choicest treasures then display,
Hurrah! Hurrah!
And let each one perform some part,
To fill wiht joy to the warrior's heart
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny come's marching home
