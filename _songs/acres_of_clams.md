[Verse 1]
I've travelled all over this country
Prospectin' and diggin' for gold,
I've tunnelled, hydraulicked and cradled,
And I have been frequently sold. 
    And I have been frequently sold,
    And I have been frequently sold
    I've tunnelled, hydraulicked and cradled,
    And I have been frequently sold

For one who gets riches by mining,
Perceiving that hundreds grow poor,
I made up my mind to try farming,
the only pursuit that is sure
    The only pursuit that is sure,
    The only pursuit that is sure.
    I made up my mind to try farming
    The only pursuit that is sure

So rolling my grub in my blanket,
I left all my tools on the ground
And started one morning to shank it
For a country they call Puget Sound
    For a country they call Puget Sound
    For a country they call Pugent Sound
    And started one morning to shank it
    For a country they call Puget sound

No longer the slave of ambition,
I laugh at the world and its shams
And think of my happy condition
Surrounded by acres of clams.
    Surrounded by acres of clams
    Surrounded by acres of clams.
    And think of my happy condition
    Surrounded by acres of clams.
