[Verse 1]
As I was walking down the street,
Down the street, down the street,
A pretty little girl I chanced to meet,
And we danced by the light of the moon.

[Chorus]
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight,
Come out tonight, come out tonight?
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight,
And dance by the light of the moon?

[Verse 2]
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking
And her heel kept a-knockin' and her toes kept a-rockin'
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking
And we danced by the light of the moon

[*Chorus*]
