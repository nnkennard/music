[Verse 1]
I stood on the Atlantic Ocean, on the wide Pacific shore,
Hear the Queen of flowing mountains to the South Belle by the door.
She's long, tall and handsome, she's loved by one and all.
She's a modern combination called the Wabash Cannonball.

[Chorus]
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar.
Riding thru the woodlands, to the hill and by the shore.
Hear the mighty rush of engines, hear the lonesome hobo squall,
Riding thru the jungles on the Wabash Cannonball

[Verse 2]
Now the eastern states are dandies, so the western people say
From New York to St Louis, and Chicago by the way,
Thru the hills of Minnesota, where the rippling waters fall
No chances can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball.

[*Chorus*]

[Verse 3]
Here's to Daddy Claxton, may his name forever stand
Will he be remembered through parts of all our land
When his early race is over and the curtain round him falls
We'll carry him on to victory on the Wabash Cannonball

[*Chorus*]
