Children, Go where I send thee, 
How shall I send thee?
I'm gonna send thee one by one,
One for the little bitty baby,
Born, born, Born in Bethlehem.

Children, Go where I send thee,
How shal I send thee?
I'm gonna send thee two by two, 
Two for Paul and Silas,
One for the little bitty baby,
Born, born, born in Bethlehem.

Three for the Hebrew children,

Four for the for who stood at the door,

Five for the gospel preachers,

Six for the six that never got fixed,

Seven for the seven that never got to heaven,

Eight for the eight that stood at the gate,

Nine for the nine who looked so fine,

Ten for the ten commandments,
