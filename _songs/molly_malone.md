[Verse 1]
In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty,
'Twas there that I first met sweet Molly Malone.
She wheeled her wheelbarrow through the streets broad and narrow
Cryin' "Cockles and Mussels, alive, alive oh!"

[Chorus]
Alive, alive, oh! Alive, alive oh!
Crying "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh!"

[Verse 2]
She was a fishmonger, but sure 'twas no wonder,
For so were her father and mother before.
And they pushed their wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow,
Crying "Cockles and mussles, alive, alive oh!"

[*Chorus*]

[Verse 3]
She died of a "faver," and no one could save her,
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Her ghost wheels her barrow, through the streets broad and narrow
Crying "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh!"

[*Chorus*]
