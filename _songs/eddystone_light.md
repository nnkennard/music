[Verse 1]
My father was the keeper of the Eddystone Light,
and he slept with a mermaid one fine night.
From this union there came three,
A porpoise and a porgy and the other was me.

[Chorus]
Yo-ho-ho, the wind blows free,
Oh for the life on the rolling sea!

[Verse 2]
One night as I was a trimming of the glim,
Singing a verse from the evening hymn,
A voice on the starboard shouted 'Ahoy!'
and there was my mother, a-sitting on a buoy.

[*Chorus*]

[Verse 3]
"Oh where are the rest of my children three?"
My mother then she asked of me.
"One was exhibited as a talking fish,
The other was served from a chafing dish."

[*Chorus*]

[Verse 4]
Then the phosphorous flashed in her seaweed hair,
I looked again and my mother wasn't there.
But her voice came echoing back from the night,
"To Hell with the keeper of the Eddystone Light!"

[*Chorus*]
