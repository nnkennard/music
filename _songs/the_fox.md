The fox went out on a chilly night,
Prayed for the moon to give him light,
For he'd many a mile to go that night
Before he reached the town-o, 
Town-o, town-o
Many a mile to go that night
Before he reached the town-o

He ran till he came to a great big bin
The ducks and the geese were put therein
Said "A couple of you will grease my chin,
Before I leave this town-o,
Town-o, town-o
A couple of you will grease my chin,
Before I leave this town-o."

He grabed the grey goose by the neck,
Slung the little one over his neck,
He didn't mind their quack-quack-quack
And the legs all dangling down-o... *etc*

Old mother pitter-patter jumped out of bed
Out of the window she cocked her head
Crying, "John, John, the grey goose is gone!
And the fox is on the town-o..." *etc*

John he went to the top of the hill,
Blew his horn both loud and shrill; 
The fox he said "I better flee with my kill,
He'll soon be on my trail-o..." *etc*

He ran till he came to his cozy den
There were the little ones, eight, nine, ten,
They said, "Daddy, you better go back again,
Cause it must be a mighty fine town-o..." *etc*

Then the fox and his wife without any strife
Cut up the goose with the fork and knife,
They never had such a supper in their life,
And the little ones chewed on the bones-o... *etc*
