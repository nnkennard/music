[Chorus]
Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new

[Verse 1]
Tell her not to get upset
Second-guessing everything you said and done
And then when she gets upset
Tell her how you never meant to hurt no one
Then you tell her that the only way her heart will mend
Is when she learns to love again
And it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend
And then you let her down easy

[Chorus]
Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new

[Verse 2]
Don't you tell her how I give you something
That you never even knew you missed
Don't you even try and explain
How it's so different when we kiss
You just tell her that the only way her heart will mend
Is when she learns to love again
And it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend
And then you let her down easy

[Chorus]
Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new
And now it's gonna be me and you

[Verse 3]
And you tell her that the only way her heart will mend
Is when she learns to love again
And it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend
And then you let her down easy

[Chorus]
Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new
