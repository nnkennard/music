[Verse 1]<br>
My father was the keeper of the Eddystone Light,<br>
and he slept with a mermaid one fine night.<br>
From this union there came three,<br>
A porpoise and a porgy and the other was me.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Yo-ho-ho, the wind blows free,<br>
Oh for the life on the rolling sea!<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
One night as I was a trimming of the glim,<br>
Singing a verse from the evening hymn,<br>
A voice on the starboard shouted 'Ahoy!'<br>
and there was my mother, a-sitting on a buoy.<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
"Oh where are the rest of my children three?"<br>
My mother then she asked of me.<br>
"One was exhibited as a talking fish,<br>
The other was served from a chafing dish."<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
Then the phosphorous flashed in her seaweed hair,<br>
I looked again and my mother wasn't there.<br>
But her voice came echoing back from the night,<br>
"To Hell with the keeper of the Eddystone Light!"<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]
