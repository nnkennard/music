[Verse 1]<br>
I come from Alabama with<br>
a banjo on my knee,<br>
I'm goin' to Louisiana<br>
my true love for to see<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
It rained all night the day I left,<br>
The weather it was dry,<br>
The sun so hot, I froze to death,<br>
Susannah don't you cry.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Oh, Susannah,<br>
Oh don't you cry for me.<br>
I come from Alabama with<br>
A banjo on my knee<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
I had a dream the other night,<br>
When everything was still,<br>
I dreamed I saw Susannah,<br>
A-coming down the hill<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
A red red rose was in her cheek,<br>
A tear was in her eye.<br>
I said to her, Susannah girl,<br>
Susannah don't you cry.<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]
