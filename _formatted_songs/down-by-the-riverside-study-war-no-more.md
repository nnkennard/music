---

[Verse 1]<br>
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield,<br>
Down by the riverside, Down by the riverside, down by the riverside,<br>
I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield,<br>
Down by the riverside,<br>
Gonna study war no more<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I ain't gonna study war no more, I ain't gonna study war no more (*3x*)<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I'm gonna walk with the Prince of Peace,<br>
Down by the riverside, Down by the riverside, down by the riverside,<br>
I'm gonna walk with the Prince of Peace,<br>
Down by the riverside,<br>
And study war no more<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
I'm a'gonna shake hands around the world,<br>
Down by the riverside, Down by the riverside, down by the riverside,<br>
I'm gonna shake hands around the world,<br>
Down by the riverside,<br>
And study war no more<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]
