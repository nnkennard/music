[Verse 1]<br>
As I was walking down the street,<br>
Down the street, down the street,<br>
A pretty little girl I chanced to meet,<br>
And we danced by the light of the moon.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight,<br>
Come out tonight, come out tonight?<br>
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight,<br>
And dance by the light of the moon?<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking<br>
And her heel kept a-knockin' and her toes kept a-rockin'<br>
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking<br>
And we danced by the light of the moon<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]
