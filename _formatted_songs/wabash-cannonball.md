[Verse 1]<br>
I stood on the Atlantic Ocean, on the wide Pacific shore,<br>
Hear the Queen of flowing mountains to the South Belle by the door.<br>
She's long, tall and handsome, she's loved by one and all.<br>
She's a modern combination called the Wabash Cannonball.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar.<br>
Riding thru the woodlands, to the hill and by the shore.<br>
Hear the mighty rush of engines, hear the lonesome hobo squall,<br>
Riding thru the jungles on the Wabash Cannonball<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Now the eastern states are dandies, so the western people say<br>
From New York to St Louis, and Chicago by the way,<br>
Thru the hills of Minnesota, where the rippling waters fall<br>
No chances can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball.<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Here's to Daddy Claxton, may his name forever stand<br>
Will he be remembered through parts of all our land<br>
When his early race is over and the curtain round him falls<br>
We'll carry him on to victory on the Wabash Cannonball<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]
