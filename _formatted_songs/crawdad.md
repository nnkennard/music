You get a line and I'll get a pole, honey<br>
You get a line and I'll get a pole, babe.<br>
You get a line and I'll get a pole, <br>
And we'll go down to the crawdad hole<br>
Honey sugar baby, mine.<br>
<br>
Get up old man you slept too late, honey,<br>
Get up old man, you slept too late, babe<br>
Get up old man, you slept too late,<br>
Last piece of crawdad's on your plate<br>
Honey, sugar baby, mine.<br>
<br>
[*Continue as above*]<br>
<br>
Get up old woman, you slept too late,<br>
Crawdad man done passed your gate<br>
<br>
Along came a man with a sack on his back<br>
Packin' all the crawdads he can pack<br>
<br>
What you gonna do when the lake goes dry,<br>
Sit on the bank and watch the crawdads die<br>
<br>
What you gonna do when the crawdads die<br>
Sit on the bank until I cry<br>
<br>
I heard the duck say to the drake<br>
There ain't no crawdads in this lake.
