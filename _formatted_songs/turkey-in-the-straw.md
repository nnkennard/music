[Verse 1]<br>
As I was a-goin' on down the road,<br>
with a tired team and a heavy load,<br>
I cracked my whip and the leader sprung,<br>
I says day-day to the wagon tongue.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Turkey in the straw, (haw, haw, haw),<br>
Turkey in the hay, (hay, hay, hay),<br>
Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuck-a-haw,<br>
And hit 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Oh, I went out to milk and I didn't know how,<br>
I milked a goat instead of a cow.<br>
A monkey sittin' on a pile of straw,<br>
A-winkin' his eye at his mother-in-law.<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Well, I met Mister Catfish comin' down the stream,<br>
Says Mister Catfish, "what do you mean?"<br>
I caught Mister Catfish by the snout<br>
And I turned that Catfish wrong side out.<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
Then I come to the river and I couldn't get across,<br>
So I paid five dollars for a blind horse.<br>
Well He wouldn't go ahead and he wouldn't stand still,<br>
So he went up and down like an old saw mill<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 5]<br>
As I came down a new cut road,<br>
I met Mister Bullfrogg a-courtin' MIss Toad,<br>
And every time Miss Toad would sing,<br>
The old Bullfrog cut a pigeon wing.<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]
