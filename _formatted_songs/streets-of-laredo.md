As I walked out in the streets of Laredo,<br>
As I walked out in Laredo one day,<br>
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen<br>
All wrapped in white linen and cold as the clay.<br>
<br>
"I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy"<br>
These words he did say as I boldly stepped by,<br>
"Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story;<br>
I was shot in the breast and I know I must die.<br>
<br>
"It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing,<br>
It was once in the saddle I used to go gay;<br>
First to the dram-house and then to the card-house,<br>
Got shot in the breast; I am dying today.<br>
<br>
"Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin;<br>
Get six pretty maidens to carry my pall;<br>
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin,<br>
Roses to deaden the clods as they fall.<br>
<br>
"Oh beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly,<br>
Play the dead march as you carry me along;<br>
Take me to the green valley and lay the sod o'er me,<br>
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.<br>
<br>
"Go fetch me a cup, a cup of cold water,<br>
To cool my parched lips," the cowboy then said.<br>
Before I returned, the spirit had left him<br>
And gone to its Maker -- the cowboy was dead.<br>
<br>
We beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly,<br>
And bitterly wept as we bore him along;<br>
For we all loved our comrade, so brave young and handsome,<br>
We all loved our comrade although he'd done wrong.
