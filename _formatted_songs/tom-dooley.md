Hang your head Tom Dooley, hang your head and cry<br>
Killed poor Laura Foster, you know you're bound to die.<br>
<br>
You took her on the hillside as God almighty knows,<br>
You took her on the hillside and there you hid her clothes.<br>
<br>
You took her by the roadside where you begged to be excused,<br>
You took her by the roadside where there you hid her shoes.<br>
<br>
You took her on the hillside to make her your wife<br>
You took her on the hillside where there you took her life.<br>
<br>
Take down my old violin and play it all you please<br>
At this time tomorrow it'll be no use to me.<br>
<br>
I dug a grave four feet long, I dug it three feet deep<br>
And throwed the cold clay o'er her, and tramped it with my feet.<br>
<br>
This world and one more then where do you reckon I'd be<br>
If it hadn't been for Grayson, I'd-a-been in Tennessee.
