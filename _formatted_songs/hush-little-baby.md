Hush little baby, don't say a word,<br>
Momma's gonna buy you a mockingbird.<br>
<br>
If that mockingbird don't sing, <br>
Momma's gonna buy you a diamond ring.<br>
<br>
If that diamond ring is glass,<br>
Momma's gonna buy you a looking glass.<br>
<br>
If that looking glass gets broke, <br>
Momma's gonna buy you a billy goad.<br>
<br>
If that billy goat won't pull, <br>
Momma's gonna buy you a cart and bull.<br>
<br>
If that cart and bull turn over,<br>
Momma's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.<br>
<br>
If that dog named Rover won't bark,<br>
Momma's gonna buy you a horse and card.<br>
<br>
If that horse and cart fall down, <br>
you'll be the sweetest baby in town.
