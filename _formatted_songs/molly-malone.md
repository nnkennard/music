[Verse 1]<br>
In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty,<br>
'Twas there that I first met sweet Molly Malone.<br>
She wheeled her wheelbarrow through the streets broad and narrow<br>
Cryin' "Cockles and Mussels, alive, alive oh!"<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Alive, alive, oh! Alive, alive oh!<br>
Crying "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh!"<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
She was a fishmonger, but sure 'twas no wonder,<br>
For so were her father and mother before.<br>
And they pushed their wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow,<br>
Crying "Cockles and mussles, alive, alive oh!"<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
She died of a "faver," and no one could save her,<br>
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone<br>
Her ghost wheels her barrow, through the streets broad and narrow<br>
Crying "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh!"<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]
