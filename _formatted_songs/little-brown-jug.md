[Verse 1]<br>
My wife and I live all alone <br>
In a little log hut we call our own;<br>
She likes gin and I like rum <br>
And I'll tell you we have lots of fun.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Ha, ha, ha, you and me, <br>
Little brown jug how I love thee! <br>
Ha, ha, ha, you and me, <br>
Little brown jug how I love thee!<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
'Tis you who makes my friends, my foes,<br>
'Tis you who makes me wear old clothes,<br>
But here you are so near my nose,<br>
So tip her up and down she goes!<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
When I go toiling on my farm, <br>
Little brown jug under my arm,<br>
Place her under a shady tree, <br>
Little brown jug don't I love thee?<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
I lay in the shade of a tree, <br>
Little brown jug in the shade of me,<br>
I raise her up and give a pull, <br>
Little brown jug's about half full<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 5]<br>
Crossed the creek on a hollow log, <br>
Me and the wife and the little brown dog<br>
The wife and the dog fell in kerplunk, <br>
But I held on to the little brown jug.<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 6]<br>
One day when I went out to my barn,<br>
Little brown jug under my arm,<br>
Tripped my toe and down I fell,<br>
Broke that little jug all to hell.<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 7]<br>
If I had a cow that gave such milk,<br>
I'd dress her in the finest silk,<br>
Feed her on the choicest hay,<br>
And milk her forty times a day.<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 8]<br>
I bought a cow from farmer Jones,<br>
And she was nothing but skin and bones;<br>
I fed her up as fine as silk<br>
She jumped the fence and strained her milk.<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 9]<br>
When I die, don't bury me at all,<br>
Just pickle my bones in alcohol;<br>
Put a bottle o'booze at my head and feet,<br>
And then I know that I will keep!<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 10]<br>
If all the folks in Adam's race<br>
Were gathered together in one place,<br>
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear<br>
Before I'd part with you, my dear<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]<br>
<br>
[Verse 11]<br>
The rose is red, my nose is too<br>
The violet's blue, and so are you<br>
And I guess before I stop,<br>
I'd better take another drop!<br>
<br>
[*Chorus*]
