title: Froggie Went A-Courting
---

Mister Froggie went a-courting and he did ride, mhmm, mhmm<br>
Mister Froggie when a-courting and he did ride,<br>
With a sword and pistol by his side mhmm, mhmm<br>
<br>
So off he went with his opera hat mhmm, mhmm<br>
So off he went with his opera hat, <br>
And on the way he met a rat mhmm, mhmm<br>
<br>
[*Continue as above*]<br>
<br>
But he went on to Miss Mouse's door<br>
Where he had been many times before<br>
<br>
He took Miss Mousy on his knee<br>
And asked her "Will you marry mee?"<br>
<br>
"Without my daddy Rat's consent,<br>
I wouldnt' marry the President."<br>
<br>
So uncle Rat gave his consent,<br>
And the Weasel wrote the publishment.<br>
<br>
The owl did hoot and the birds they sang<br>
All through the woods the music rang.<br>
<br>
What will the wedding breakfast be?<br>
Two green beans and a black-eyed pea.<br>
<br>
They all went sailing across the brook,<br>
And a big white duck came and gobbled them up.<br>
<br>
There's bread and cheese upon the shelf,<br>
If you want anymore you can sing it yourself.
