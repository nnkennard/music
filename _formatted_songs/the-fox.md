The fox went out on a chilly night,<br>
Prayed for the moon to give him light,<br>
For he'd many a mile to go that night<br>
Before he reached the town-o, <br>
Town-o, town-o<br>
Many a mile to go that night<br>
Before he reached the town-o<br>
<br>
He ran till he came to a great big bin<br>
The ducks and the geese were put therein<br>
Said "A couple of you will grease my chin,<br>
Before I leave this town-o,<br>
Town-o, town-o<br>
A couple of you will grease my chin,<br>
Before I leave this town-o."<br>
<br>
He grabed the grey goose by the neck,<br>
Slung the little one over his neck,<br>
He didn't mind their quack-quack-quack<br>
And the legs all dangling down-o... *etc*<br>
<br>
Old mother pitter-patter jumped out of bed<br>
Out of the window she cocked her head<br>
Crying, "John, John, the grey goose is gone!<br>
And the fox is on the town-o..." *etc*<br>
<br>
John he went to the top of the hill,<br>
Blew his horn both loud and shrill; <br>
The fox he said "I better flee with my kill,<br>
He'll soon be on my trail-o..." *etc*<br>
<br>
He ran till he came to his cozy den<br>
There were the little ones, eight, nine, ten,<br>
They said, "Daddy, you better go back again,<br>
Cause it must be a mighty fine town-o..." *etc*<br>
<br>
Then the fox and his wife without any strife<br>
Cut up the goose with the fork and knife,<br>
They never had such a supper in their life,<br>
And the little ones chewed on the bones-o... *etc*
