[Verse 1]<br>
I've travelled all over this country<br>
Prospectin' and diggin' for gold,<br>
I've tunnelled, hydraulicked and cradled,<br>
And I have been frequently sold. <br>
    And I have been frequently sold,<br>
    And I have been frequently sold<br>
    I've tunnelled, hydraulicked and cradled,<br>
    And I have been frequently sold<br>
<br>
For one who gets riches by mining,<br>
Perceiving that hundreds grow poor,<br>
I made up my mind to try farming,<br>
the only pursuit that is sure<br>
    The only pursuit that is sure,<br>
    The only pursuit that is sure.<br>
    I made up my mind to try farming<br>
    The only pursuit that is sure<br>
<br>
So rolling my grub in my blanket,<br>
I left all my tools on the ground<br>
And started one morning to shank it<br>
For a country they call Puget Sound<br>
    For a country they call Puget Sound<br>
    For a country they call Pugent Sound<br>
    And started one morning to shank it<br>
    For a country they call Puget sound<br>
<br>
No longer the slave of ambition,<br>
I laugh at the world and its shams<br>
And think of my happy condition<br>
Surrounded by acres of clams.<br>
    Surrounded by acres of clams<br>
    Surrounded by acres of clams.<br>
    And think of my happy condition<br>
    Surrounded by acres of clams.
