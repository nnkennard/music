[Chorus]<br>
Call your girlfriend<br>
It's time you had the talk<br>
Give your reasons<br>
Say it's not her fault<br>
But you just met somebody new<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Tell her not to get upset<br>
Second-guessing everything you said and done<br>
And then when she gets upset<br>
Tell her how you never meant to hurt no one<br>
Then you tell her that the only way her heart will mend<br>
Is when she learns to love again<br>
And it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend<br>
And then you let her down easy<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Call your girlfriend<br>
It's time you had the talk<br>
Give your reasons<br>
Say it's not her fault<br>
But you just met somebody new<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Don't you tell her how I give you something<br>
That you never even knew you missed<br>
Don't you even try and explain<br>
How it's so different when we kiss<br>
You just tell her that the only way her heart will mend<br>
Is when she learns to love again<br>
And it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend<br>
And then you let her down easy<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Call your girlfriend<br>
It's time you had the talk<br>
Give your reasons<br>
Say it's not her fault<br>
But you just met somebody new<br>
And now it's gonna be me and you<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
And you tell her that the only way her heart will mend<br>
Is when she learns to love again<br>
And it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend<br>
And then you let her down easy<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Call your girlfriend<br>
It's time you had the talk<br>
Give your reasons<br>
Say it's not her fault<br>
Call your girlfriend<br>
It's time you had the talk<br>
Give your reasons<br>
Say it's not her fault<br>
But you just met somebody new
