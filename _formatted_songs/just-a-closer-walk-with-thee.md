Just a closer walk with Thee,<br>
Grant it Jesus if you please.<br>
Daily walking close to Thee,<br>
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.<br>
<br>
Through the days of toil that's near<br>
If I fall dear Lord, who cares<br>
Who with me my burden share,<br>
None but Thee, dear Lord, None but Thee.<br>
<br>
When my feeble life is o'er<br>
Time for me will be no more;<br>
Guide me gently safely on,<br>
To Thy shore, dear Lord, to Thy shore.
