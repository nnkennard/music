[Verse 1]<br>
On top of Old Smoky,<br>
All covered with snow,<br>
I lost my true lover,<br>
from a courtin' too slow<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
For courting is pleasure,<br>
and parting is grief,<br>
And a false-hearted lover<br>
Is worse than a thief.<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
A thief will just rob you<br>
And take what you have,<br>
But a false-hearted lover<br>
Will lead you to the grave.<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
And the grave will decay you,<br>
And turn you to dust,<br>
Not one boy in hundred,<br>
A poor girl can trust<br>
<br>
[Verse 5]<br>
They'll hug you and kiss you<br>
And tell you more lies,<br>
Than the cross-ties on the railroad<br>
Or the stars in the skies.<br>
<br>
[Verse 6]<br>
So come all you young maidens<br>
And listen to me,<br>
Never place your affection,<br>
On a green willow tree<br>
<br>
[Verse 7]<br>
For the leaves they will wither<br>
And the roots they will die,<br>
You'll all be forsaken<br>
And never know why
