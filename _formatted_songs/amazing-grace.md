Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound<br>
That saved a wretch like me;<br>
I once was lost, and now I'm found,<br>
Was blind but now I see.<br>
<br>
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,<br>
And grace my fears relieved;<br>
How precious did that grace appear,<br>
The hour I first believed.<br>
<br>
Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares<br>
I have already come.<br>
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,<br>
And grace will lead me home.<br>
<br>
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds<br>
In a believer's ear.<br>
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,<br>
And drives away his fear.<br>
<br>
Must Jesus bear the cross alone<br>
And all the world go free?<br>
No there's a cross for everyone<br>
And there's a cross for me.
