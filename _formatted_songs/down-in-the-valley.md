title: Down In The Valley
---

Down in the valley, the valley so low<br>
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Roses love sunshine, violets love dew<br>
Angels in heaven, know I love you.<br>
Know I love you, dear, know I love you.<br>
Angels in heaven, know I ove you.<br>
<br>
If you don't love me, love whom you please.<br>
Throw your arms round me, give my heart ease.<br>
Give my heart ease, love, give my heart ease.<br>
Throw your arms round me, give my heart ease.<br>
<br>
Build me a castle forty feet high<br>
So I can see him as he rides by.<br>
As he rides by, love, as he rides by<br>
So I can see him as he rides by.<br>
<br>
Write me a letter, send it by mail<br>
Send it in care of Birmingham jail.<br>
Birmingham jail, love, Birmingham jail<br>
Send it in care of, Birmingham jail.<br>
<br>
[*Repeat first verse*]
