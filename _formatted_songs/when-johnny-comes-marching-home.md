title: When Johnny Comes Marching Home
---

[Verse 1]<br>
When Johnny comes marching home again<br>
Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
We'll give him a hearty welcome then<br>
Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
The men will cheer and the boys will shout,<br>
The ladies, they will all turn out,<br>
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny come's marching home<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
The old church bell will peak with joy<br>
Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
To welcome home our darling boy<br>
Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
The village lads and lassies say,<br>
With roses they will strew the way,<br>
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny come's marching home<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Get ready for the jubilee,<br>
Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
We'll give the hero three times three,<br>
Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
The laurel wreath is ready now,<br>
To place upon his loyal brow,<br>
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny come's marching home<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
Let love and friendship on that day,<br>
Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
Their choicest treasures then display,<br>
Hurrah! Hurrah!<br>
And let each one perform some part,<br>
To fill wiht joy to the warrior's heart<br>
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny come's marching home
